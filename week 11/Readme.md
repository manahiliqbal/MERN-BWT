**Flashcards SaaS Application**
The Flashcards SaaS Application is a web-based platform designed to help users create, organize, and study flashcards effectively. Developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), it offers a smooth and intuitive user experience.
Users can easily sign up, log in, and manage their flashcards through a responsive and visually appealing interface built with React and Tailwind CSS. The app supports features like dark mode, enhancing the study experience in different lighting conditions.
On the backend, the Express server handles user authentication, flashcard storage, and retrieval, securely storing data in a MongoDB database. The application also integrates with Stripe for payment processing, enabling premium features for advanced users.
